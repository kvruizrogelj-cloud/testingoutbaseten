        Analyze the key pain points that traditional, non-AI-native enterprise customers{industry_context} face when considering AI adoption. These are companies with legacy infrastructure, traditional IT teams, and limited AI experience:

        1. AI ADOPTION BARRIERS:
        - "We don't know where to start with AI"
        - Fear of complex technical implementation
        - Uncertainty about which AI use cases to prioritize
        - Lack of internal AI talent and expertise
        - Concerns about disrupting existing business processes

        2. INFRASTRUCTURE CONCERNS:
        - Legacy systems integration challenges
        - Security and compliance requirements (SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR)
        - Existing vendor relationships and procurement processes
        - Budget approval processes for new technology categories
        - Risk aversion to "bleeding edge" technology

        3. BUSINESS JUSTIFICATION CHALLENGES:
        - Difficulty quantifying AI ROI
        - Unclear timeline for AI implementation and results
        - Competition priorities with other IT initiatives
        - Board/executive skepticism about AI hype
        - Pressure to show quick wins vs long-term transformation

        4. ORGANIZATIONAL READINESS:
        - IT teams without ML/AI experience
        - Resistance to change from existing teams
        - Skills gap and training requirements
        - Cross-departmental coordination for AI initiatives
        - Managing expectations across stakeholder groups

        For each area, provide:
        - How Baseten reduces complexity and risk for traditional enterprises
        - Positioning Baseten as "enterprise-grade" vs "startup technology"
        - Proof points that address conservative buyer concerns
        - Business case frameworks that resonate with traditional IT leadership

        Focus on positioning Baseten as the safe, enterprise-ready choice for companies taking their first serious steps into AI.

        Analyze the ML infrastructure competitive landscape for traditional enterprise IT teams evaluating AI solutions:

        1. ENTERPRISE EVALUATION CRITERIA:
        - Vendor stability and enterprise credibility
        - Security, compliance, and governance features
        - Integration with existing enterprise infrastructure
        - Support and professional services availability
        - Total cost of ownership vs complexity
        - Risk mitigation and business continuity

        2. COMPETITORS analyzed through enterprise IT lens:

        AWS SageMaker:
        - Strengths: Enterprise trust, comprehensive ecosystem, compliance certifications
        - Weaknesses: Complexity, steep learning curve, unpredictable costs, vendor lock-in

        Google Vertex AI:
        - Strengths: AI expertise, integrated platform, good documentation
        - Weaknesses: Limited enterprise sales support, complex pricing, newer in enterprise

        Azure ML:
        - Strengths: Microsoft relationship, enterprise integration, familiar tooling
        - Weaknesses: Performance concerns, limited model variety, Azure dependency

        Traditional vendors (IBM, Oracle, etc.):
        - Strengths: Enterprise relationships, professional services
        - Weaknesses: Legacy technology, high costs, slow innovation

        3. BASETEN'S ENTERPRISE POSITIONING:
        - "Enterprise-ready AI infrastructure without the complexity"
        - Faster deployment than cloud providers with enterprise security
        - Transparent, predictable pricing vs hyperscaler complexity
        - Proven reliability for companies deploying AI at scale
        - Professional support without vendor lock-in

        Format this for enterprise IT decision-makers and procurement teams.
